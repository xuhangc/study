# Applied Machine Learning: Foundations

## Basics

Fitting a function to examples and using that function to generalize and make predictions about new examples.

***Pattern matching***

- Does it require a prediction or bucketing something into categories?
- Is the problem relatively self-contained?
- Do I have data with labels?
- Do I have the ability to assess the quality of the model?
- Can I determine an acceptable accuracy threshold?

***Why Python***

- popularity
- more machine learning packages
- easy to learn, easy to use

***Deep learning***

Fitting functions to examples where those functions are connected layers of nodes; with the intent to generalize and make predictions about new examples

connected pattern matching

***Artifical Intelligence***

Weak AI - intelligence specifically designed to focus on a narrow task

Strong/general AI - a machine with consciousness, sentience, and a mind; general intelligence capable of any and all cognitive functions and reasoning that a human is capable of

### Challenges

#### Problem scoping
- The right problem isn't being solved
- Tolerance threshold is undetermined
- Impact in real environment can't be measured

#### Data
- Lack of data/data sensitivity
- Too much data
- Data doesn't have labels
- Data is too biased, dirty, noisy, incomplete, etc.

#### Infrastructure
- Lack skills to robustly automate
- Not enough computer power
- Inability to A/B test with existing solution
- Inability to continously track model quality
